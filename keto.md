# Kai's Anecdotal Guide to Keto
  
## Why
  
Someone asked me for tips on being keto from my time doing it. Figured I'd write it in a place where I could refine it, share it out, etc.
  
## Caveat
  
I am not a doctor. I am not a nutritionist. I've read some things on the internet, and now I know just enough to be dangerous. May what you read here not kill you, debilitate you, adversely affect your relationships, lower your GPA, or take the spring out of your step.
  
## tl;dr
  
  1. Eat a *lot* of fat, don't eat many carbs. (Ballpark for a 2000 calorie diet could look like 25g *net* carbs or less, 100g protein, 167g fat.)
  2. Keto flu is a thing. You will lose water when you start keto, and that will take electrolytes with it. Drink water with .25 tsp Lite Salt... twice a day?
  3. It's important to have good snacks. Fatty meats and cheeses are your friends. Nuts and very dark chocolate in moderation.
  4. You'll probably miss crunchy things. Pork rinds, pickles, and celery are your friends.
  5. You'll probably miss sweets. Keto bombs and chia puddings and alternative sweeteners (monkfruit!) are your friends. 
  6. Drinking is hard on keto. You shouldn't drink anything besides straight liquor. But also, you have no carbs to pad your stomach and you're prone to dehydration. Drinking is hard on keto.

## More details

### Eat a *lot* of fat, don't eat many carbs

The basics of this are easy: you want to convince your body that carbs are not the preferred fuel because they're scarce, and that fat is a good fuel because it's abundant. There are a few tricks to this.

  1. Carbs are generally regarded as *net* carbs, meaning: total carbs - fiber - sugar alcohols. I'm sure there's more nuance, but you'd have to ask the internet.
  2. There's this thing called gluconeogenesis that I'm not even going to look up, but I believe the idea is that if you reduce carbs but eat a lot of protein and insufficient fat, your body will do the work to make the protein into carbs and now you're still not keto. Oops! Eat that fat, friend.

### Keto flu

Getting into ketosis can be a bit of a pain. It'll probably take a few days, and you'll probably feel suboptimal. Up to you whether you want to ruin a few good days of work or a few good days of weekend/vacation. Some of this can be mitigated by staying hydrated and keeping those electrolytes coming in, but it's very YMMV, and a little brain fog is still likely. Fun fact: you can probably get into keto fastest by (appropriately) fasting and being *lightly* active to try to exhaust those muscle glycogen supplies. But that is its own kind of sacrifice, and I still don't have a firm timeline for you. Choose your devil.

### Electrolyes

Good news: you'll probably get plenty of sodium. But some of these will be hard to get on keto. Take a look at the NIH page on potassium. Top sources? Dried apricots, lentils, prunes, squash, raisins, potatoes, kidney beans, orange juice. Oops, can't eat those! Soybeans? In limited quantities. And potassium is already something where it's difficult to get the Adequate Intake, especially if you're a man, but that's a whole other soapbox. Eat avocadoes and spinach, and drink that Lite Salt, friend.

### Eating

As they say, the diet/workout/whatver that you keep doing is the best one. For me, adherence meant doing the same thing for breakfast every day and the same thing for lunch every day so that I didn't have to think about it. It's not an interesting way to eat, but most of the time, as much as I like food and variety, I also don't mind eating the same thing over and over. I'm lucky like that.

#### My Breakfast
* Coffee
* .25c heavy cream to sip with coffee
* Two hardboiled eggs
* Two strips bacon
* Cornichons

#### My Lunch
* Kale salad with lemon-dijon-EVOO dressing
* Can of sardines
* Half avocado

#### My Dinners
I have a partner who isn't keto, so I'd often make something with a carb base (e.g. salmon and rice, pasta and meat sauce, hamburgers with buns, tex mex tacos, chicken quesadillas), and I'd replace the carb with some manner of green. Lettuce, kale, whatever. Or, if it was something where I was already making e.g. brussels sprouts on the side, I'd just make an extra large helping for myself.

#### Snacks
I probably had more nuts than I should've, and not all of them are created equal. (Cashews are the enemy.)

I'd have a few small squares of dark chocolate per day and it didn't seem to hurt me at all. I like the [not-quite-murderously dark stuff](https://www.chocolatebar.com/products/dark-chocolate-with-88-cocoa/).

QFC has little bags of cubed cheeses that I'd keep in the fridge and graze on.

I'd also get some [big ol' meat sticks](https://hemplers.com/product/classic-pepperoni/) and slice them into ~3 inch segments.

I kept pork rinds around (and there's an increasingly good selection of them; I like [the ones from Dot's](https://www.kroger.com/p/dot-s-homestyle-pork-rinds/0085571200865) when I eat them these days), and while they were good to have at home, they were even better to take to parties so that I'd have an alternative to chips and crackers. Bring along a terrine for extra fun.

Oh, put cream cheese on everything and anything. Maybe make some of those ham wraps with cream cheese and scallions. This is your time to be made of cream cheese.

#### Desserts

I had these in two forms that I never really perfected: keto bombs and chia puddings.

##### Keto bombs

My version of this involved mixing up fresh ground almond butter (from the machine at the store), tahini, and coconut oil (heated just enough to make it liquid) with cocoa powder, monkfruit sugar, a pinch of salt, and sometimes, I don't know, a little cinnamon, a little cayenne, then pouring it all into tiny ice cube molds. Ended up with little truffles, kind of. I'll post my base recipe if I can find it. The internet has a million recipes, though. Check 'em out.

##### Chia puddings

So, if you let chia seeds sit in a fluid for a while, they get all gelatinous and you got yourself a pudding! In my case, it'd be something like a can of coconut milk to two tablespoons of chia seeds, maybe? Then flavorings, which weren't dissimilar from the keto bomb flavorings I mentioned. This is another one where you google and drown in a sea of options.

## Things I haven't mentioned

* I've never done any testing to see if I'm in keto. If I were smarter, I probably would do the pee strips. If I had more money, I'd get a thing to measure by breath.
* MCTs. It's a whole thing. Get that brain fuel! they say. Buy my expensive fats! they say. I never investigated enough to know if there was any fire to that smoke.
* There's keto bread at the store. I haven't tried it. I don't know much about the nutrition. Give it a shot if you want.
* You can make your own bread. Google `fathead bread`. I never really got into that.
* Intermittent fasting. That's an orthogonal vector with its own benefits (specualtive or otherwise) and drawbacks.
